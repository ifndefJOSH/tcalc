		<h1>TCalc - the Terrible Calculator<h1>

		<p>TCalc, or "the Terrible Calculator" is a JavaScript/Tauri/Rust calculator app written by <a href="https://github.com/ifndefJOSH">ifndefJOSH</a> instead of refining his QEST'23 submission two days before a deadline. It is licensed under the MIT license, because I don't want to imply any sort of warranty or whatever.</p>
