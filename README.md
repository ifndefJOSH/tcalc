# TCalc - the Terrible Calculator

*Rome wasn't built in a day, but TCalc was!*

I was trying to get somewhat familiar with Tauri, but just ended up writing a ||expletive|| JavaScript calculator.

Can compile for:

- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows
- Android (I'm told)
- iOS (Supposedly)

You will need `cargo` and `tauri`.

```bash
# Builds this horribleness
cargo tauri build

# Builds for a specific platform
cargo tauri build --target <your target>
```
